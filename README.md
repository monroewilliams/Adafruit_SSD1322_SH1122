# Adafruit SSD1322

This is a library to support displays based on the SSD1322 chipset.
It is based directly on the Adafruit SSD1327 Arduino Library for Arduino.

These displays use SPI to communicate.

# Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please read our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_SSD1327/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md>)
before contributing to help this project stay welcoming.

## Documentation and doxygen
Documentation is produced by doxygen. Contributions should include documentation for any new code added.

Some examples of how to use doxygen can be found in these guide pages:

## Formatting and clang-format
This library uses [`clang-format`](https://releases.llvm.org/download.html) to standardize the formatting of `.cpp` and `.h` files. 
Contributions should be formatted using `clang-format`:

The `-i` flag will make the changes to the file.
```bash
clang-format -i *.cpp *.h
```
If you prefer to make the changes yourself, running `clang-format` without the `-i` flag will print out a formatted version of the file. You can save this to a file and diff it against the original to see the changes.

Note that the formatting output by `clang-format` is what the automated formatting checker will expect. Any diffs from this formatting will result in a failed build until they are addressed. Using the `-i` flag is highly recommended.
